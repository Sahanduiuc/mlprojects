    "- Instead of squashing images, center-crop them to a specific size. Also, do multiple crops and use these to augment your input data, so that the original image will be split into different images of correct size.\n",
    "- Padding the images with a solid color: The padding option might introduce an additional error source to the network's prediction, as the network might (read: likely will) be biased to images that contain such a padded border.\n",
    "- Make a spatial pyramid pooling layer and put it after your last convolution layer so that the FC layers always get constant dimensional vectors as input.\n",
    "- [Spatial Pyramid Pooling in Deep Convolutional Networks for Visual Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4729)\n",
    "- When you're dealing with object detection and instance segmentation, anchor box sizes which are also hyperparameters need to adjust if you have a dataset with high variance in image sizes."
