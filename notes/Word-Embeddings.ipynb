    "- So, instead of a one-hot presentation, we should learn a featurized representation.\n",
    "- Word embeddings are in fact a class of techniques which represent individual words as real-valued vectors in a predefined vector space, where semantically similar words are mapped to nearby points ('are embedded nearby each other').\n",

This is contrasted to the thousands or millions of dimensions required for sparse word representations, such as a one-hot encoding.\n",

    "    - Jointly: the embedding is learned as part of a large task-specific model.\n",
    "- Instead of training own embeddings from scratch, pre-trained word embeddings can be used:\n",
    "    - Static: the embedding is kept static and is used as a component of the model.\n",
    "    - Updated: the pre-trained embedding is used to seed the model, but the embedding is updated jointly during the training of the model.\n",
    "- Transfer learning:\n",
    "    - Learn word embeddings from a large text corpus (1-100B words)\n",
    "    - Transfer the word embeddings to a new task with a smaller training set (say, 100k words)\n",
    "    - Optional: continue to finetune the word embeddings with new data"

    "- Another place you may have seen this trick is in unsupervised feature learning, where you train an auto-encoder to compress an input vector in the hidden layer, and decompress it back to the original in the output layer. After training it, you strip off the output layer (the decompression step) and just use the hidden layer - it's a trick for learning good image features without having labeled training data."

    "- Both models are focused on learning about words given their local usage context, where the context is defined by a (sliding) window of neighboring words. The size of the sliding window has a strong effect on the resulting vector similarities. Large windows tend to produce more topical similarities, while smaller windows tend to produce more functional and syntactic similarities.\n",
