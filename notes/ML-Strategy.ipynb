    "- Machine learning strategy is useful to iterate through ideas quickly and to efficiently reach the project outcome\n",

    "- To choose a classifier, a well-defined development set and an evaluation metric speed up the iteration process.\n",
    "- Pick one evaluation metric, e.g. f1-score, to instantly judge the performance of multiple models.\n",
    "- When to change dev/test sets and metrics: If you find out that the rank of your evaluation metric doesn’t accurately reflect the performance of your models anymore, consider restating the optimization metric, e.g. through adding a weighting term to heavily penalize your classifier for misclassifying really important examples."

    "- Precision. Depends on False Positive. In email spam detection, a false positive means that an email that is non-spam (actual negative) has been identified as spam (predicted spam). The email user might lose important emails if the precision is not high for the spam detection model.\n",
    "- Recall: Depends on False Negative. If a sick patient (Actual Positive) goes through the test and predicted as not sick (Predicted Negative). The cost associated with False Negative will be extremely high if the sickness is contagious.\n",

In this case, accuracy is the optimizing metric and prediction time and memory usage are satisficing metrics."

    "- Divide the training, dev and test sets in such a way that their distribution is similar\n",
    "- Training and testing on different distributions: If your data in the training set comes from mixed data sources, create the dev and test sets with the data that you want to optimize for, e.g. if you want to classify sneaker images from a phone, use a dev and test set consisting only of sneaker photos from mobile phones but feel free to use enhanced sneaker web images to train the network.\n",
