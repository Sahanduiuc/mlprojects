I started playing Resident Evil with the original 1996 release, and it was actually the first game I picked up for the
PlayStation 1. I have played every, and I mean every Resident Evil game in the series, including the spin-offs. The series has had so many ups and downs that more often than not, I often had to forces myself to finish many of the Resident Evil games. When they are great, they can be some of the best games around, but when they are bad, they can be some of the worse games I have ever had to endure. There is no other way I can put it, the series as a hole has been wildly inconsistent.

Out of all the games in the series, Resident Evil 2 has always been my favorite, there was so many things the game did right. I was 16 when Resident Evil 2 was first released, and waited outside of Buy Right Video Games before they opened for my copy. I was heavily addicted to the game for that entire year, and it never left my system until later in the year when is was time for the original Metal Gear Solid to bestow its glory. I later picked up a Sega Dreamcast to play it all over again, as it featured upgraded graphics with a new Nightmare Difficulty Mode. Resident Evil 2 was my most, and still is, the game with my greatest amount of completed speed-runs, it would fall somewhere around 100 playthroughs.

With all that being said, people will be happy to know that the remake stays very true to the original. I am sure there will be some people who will leave negative reviews regarding any changes, as some events have been rearranged or expanded upon with some surprising twists, but everything is better than the original in every conceivable way. Capcom has even added the extras from the original in the remake, such as the playable Tofu used for the games collision detection as well as HUNK. Have no fear for those who are wondering, because the remake does include the Wesker's Desk Easter egg and Brad Vickers. The game has an astronomical attention to detail while still paying homage to the original with the uttermost respect.

There are many things I would like to say but would rather not say, its one of those games people should experience for themselves. I will however say a few things. Each campaign is around 8 hours long and offers 3 difficulty settings, Assisted, Standard and Hardcore. The first 2 settings use a auto-saving and manual save feature with one being a little harder than the other. Hardcore is very hard, featuring very strong enemies and no auto-aim. Hardcore also uses the "old school" saving system, meaning players can only save using Ink Ribbons that are hidden within the games world.

Be warned, the Hardcore Mode in the remake is very extreme, and I would say it is on par with the original Evil Within Akumu Mode. The graphics and lighting are superb and uses the same engine found in Resident Evil 7. The sounds are top notched, the controls are tight and the characters move and feel real as if they have weight to them. The zombie animations and blood splatter are the most realistic I have ever seen in a game to date.

On point shooting lets players blast off arms and legs as well as heads. Throughout the journey, all previous bosses pay their respects, nothing has been cut from the game. For those who know what to expect from playing the original, I will say yes to those who are wondering, you will be "stalked" relentlessly by yours truly, and jump scares have been shifted around so players never known what to expected. Inventory and ammunition management is still key, players are given just barely enough ammo and healing items and you cannot carry everything you find, always hording what you can store.

Final Verdict:

The quality is fantastic and I would recommend the remake to anyone out there who loves horror games. Both Leon and Claire each have a top notch campaign that never deviates from the original, and the 3 difficulty options are welcoming to those who may want an easy ride as well as hardcore. Capcom said they may follow with other remakes depending on our support and feedback and so far I like what I see. I would love to see the original built from the ground up, and while I enjoyed the HD remake, its still not on the same level as a remake of this magnitude. Lets make it happen!
