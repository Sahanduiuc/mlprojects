First the good:
- Graphics, amazing
- Production value (you could tell from the painstaking detail that the programmers put their everything into this game)

Negative:
- Animations (while they are really detailed, the slowness can get annoying)
- Travel. This is a big one for me. You have to travel LONNNNNNNNNNG distances to get to where you are going and find action in this game. But travelling is not fun. It's very cinematic, it's very pretty, but it's not fun. Horses tire if you run too fast and the map is so big, except that that means there are wide areas of no activity in this wild west setting. Also, if you are galloping too fast and accidentally hit a rock, you will get thrown from your horse and die. Sometimes after travelling for a long distance.
- I swear Dead Eye was a lot easier to execute in RDR1.
- It's easy to accidentally kill NPCs. While that may sound hilarious, it's not. Especially when you are trying to accomplish an objective in the town and they all turn on you because you accidentally brushed an NPC on your horse and they ridiculously died or got hurt enough to qualify as assault. I guess this and the last couple critiques qualify as control issues.

The story itself is okay, so far. I'm about 8 hrs in and its not great, but its not terrible. The voice acting is very good, but a lot of the characters you engage with are not that particularly interesting.

I hope it picks up the more I play, but I am regretting getting the 80.00 version of this game. It takes a lot of time to progress through, and so far the payoff is not quite worth it.
