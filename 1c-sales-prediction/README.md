Sales forecasting plays a major role in a company's success. The goal of this project was to predict total sales for every product and store in the next month. This challenging time-series problem was tackled by using GBMs, linear models, neural networks, and ensembles. The project was part of the [Predict Future Sales competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales).
